# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

This project allows a user to test their knowledge on several questions of JavaScript:

- Building this project allowed me to familiarize myself with arrays and event listeners even more.
- The quiz can have more or less questions added and continue functioning as normal. It allowed me to create something functional but that can be added to easily.

## Installation

The quiz can be accessed at:

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
